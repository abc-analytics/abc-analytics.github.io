            <h1>Old, Verbose, Unfunctional</h1>
            <p>As a traditional finance guy without any formal programming training and experience, I self-learn programming from books and VS Code. </p>
            <p>I've adopted <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/">Java</a> as my primary language. As a newbie coder, I am yet to dive into the functional programming paradigm and solely focus on object-oriented thinking. Despite complaints about Java's legacy baggage and verbosity, I find it an excellent first langauge because it is formal and structured. I think its verbosity and strong/static-typing help familiarise myself with code logic and clarity. </p>
            <p>For data analysis and prototyping, I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>, <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">Jags</a>/<a href="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/">Bugs</a>. The vast and high-quality libraries their communities have contributed are invaluable and indispensable.  </p>
            <p>To build web stuff, I use Javascript, Node, Ruby, Java.</p>
            <p>On the natural language front, I am conversant in English, Japanese, and Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), and have put Spanish on my laundry list.</p>

            <h1>Technology is Democracy</h1>
            <p>Fairness and democracy are theoretical ideals in this structurally rigged world. Others have more money, more power, more connections. We are underdogs. We work much harder for much less. They do business on relationship. My data are already relational. They call their connections for favours. My codes call APIs for data. They like networking and handshaking with who's who. My programs are constantly networking and handshaking with MySQL.</p> 
            <p>All I have are a pair of working hands, a functioning brain, and a von Neumann machine. Imagination is innate. Knowledge is unbiased. Technology is empowerment. Data simulate experience. These are my sole weapons to levelling the playing field. </p>

        <section id="about-minimalism" class="about">

          <div id="" class="contents">
            <h1>Less is More</h1>
            <p>Materialism and consumption-driven model have substantially enhanced living standards and expanded that hypothetical productivity frontier. More options are often better indeed, if <i>other things</i> are equal, which are not. Excessive optionality has become noise, drowning out the signals. Intrinsically meaningless status-quo becomes the unquestioned way of life or goal in life. People's values are altered in exchange for materials. Instead of having more, doing more with less is what we should aim for. </p>
            <p>We are born naked and leave naked. That's rare fairness at endpoints. In between, I think one should strive to uphold his beliefs and values as well as single-mindedly pursuing his signals. As mere mortals, subjective life meanings are objectively meaningless and the objective function should be to minimise regrets rather than to maximise variables. That way, at least one can have something to self-illude rather than manipulated by outside forces. As <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Albert Camus</a></i> said, life is essentially absurd and one should rebel the meaninglessness by living and thinking freely.</p>
