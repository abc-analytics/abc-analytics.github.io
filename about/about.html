            <h1>Old, Verbose, Unfunctional</h1>
            <p>As a traditional finance guy without any formal programming training and experience, I self-learn programming from books and VS Code. </p>
            <p>I've adopted Java as my primary language. As a newbie coder, I am yet to dive into the functional programming paradigm and solely focus on object-oriented thinking. Despite complaints about Java's legacy baggage and verbosity, I find it an excellent first langauge because it is formal and structured. I think its verbosity and strong/static-typing familiarise myself with code logic and clarity. When I become sufficiently proficient in Java, Scala and OCaml will be gradually added to the mix.</p>
            <p>For data analysis and prototyping, I rely on Python and R. Their flexibility, vertorized operations, and vast numerical libraries are invaluable.</p>
            <p>To build web stuff, I use Javascript, Node, Ruby, Java, and Swift.</p>
            <p>On human languages, I am conversant in English, Japanese, and Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), and have put Spanish on my laundry list.</p>

            <h1>Technology is Democracy</h1>
            <p>Fairness and democracy are theoretical ideals in this structurally rigged world. Others have more money, more power, more connections. We are underdogs. We work much harder for much less. They do business on relationship. My data are already relational. They call their connections for favours. My codes call APIs for data. They like networking and handshaking with who's who. My programs are constantly networking and handshaking with MySQL.</p> 
            <p>All I have are a pair of working hands, a functioning brain, and a von Neumann machine. Knowledge is unbiased. Technology is empowerment. Data simulate experience. These are my sole weapons to levelling the playing field. </p>

          <div id="" class="contents">
            <h1>Less is More</h1>
            <p>Under capitalism, society has come to cherish abundance and materials by default. Minds have become wired to think consumption is good and more is better similar to blindly seeing thinness as beauty. </p>
            <p>Granted. Materialism and consumption-driven model have substantially enhanced living standards and expanded that hypothetical productivity frontier. More options are often better indeed, if <i>other things</i> are equal, which are not. Excessive optionality has become noise, drowning out the signals. Intrinsically meaningless status-quo becomes the unquestioned way of life or goal in life. People's values are altered in exchange for materials. Instead of having more, doing more with less is what we should aim for. </p>
            <p>We are born naked and leave naked. That's rare fairness at endpoints. In between, I think one should strive to uphold his beliefs and values as well as single-mindedly pursuing his signal of life. As mere mortals, subjective life meanings are objectively meaningless and the objective function should be to minimise regrets rather than to maximise variables. That way, at least one can have something to self-illude.</p>
