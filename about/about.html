            <h1>Old, Verbose, Unfunctional</h1>
            <p>As a traditional finance guy without any formal programming training and experience, I self-learn programming from books and VS Code. </p>
            <p>I've adopted Java as my primary language. As a newbie coder, I am yet to dive into the functional programming paradigm and solely focus on object-oriented thinking. Despite complaints about Java's legacy baggage and verbosity, I find it an excellent first langauge because of its formality and large community. I think its verbosity and static-typing promote clarity and logical thinking. It is the only full-fledged and high-performance language I know (and think ever need).</p>
            <p>For data analysis and prototyping, I rely on Python and R. Their flexibility, vertorized operations, and powerful libraries are truly invaluable.</p>
            <p>To build web stuff, I use Javascript, Node.js, Ruby, Java, and Swift.</p>
            <p>On human languages, I am conversant in English, Japanese, and Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), and have put Spanish on my laundry list.</p>

            <h1>Technology is Democracy</h1>
            <p>Fairness and democracy are theoretical ideals in this structurally rigged world. Others have more money, more power, more connections. We are underdogs. We work much harder for much less. They do business on relationship. My data are already relational. They call their connections for favours. My codes call APIs for data. They like networking and handshaking with who's who. My programs are constantly networking and handshaking with MySQL.</p> 
            <p>All I have are a pair of working hands, a functioning brain, and a von Neumann machine. Knowledge is unbiased. Technology is empowerment. Data simulate experience. These are my sole weapons to levelling the playing field. I keep on trying.</p>
